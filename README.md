# qt4-mimetypes
It is the "fork" of Qt4 mimetypes project from qtplayground at [gitorious.org](https://qt.gitorious.org/qtplayground/mimetypes) which is going to be shut down the end of May 2015 so the link might no longer work. 
For now this "fork" would exist only for the preservation of this project still valuable for those still using Qt4 i.e. I don't plan any specific developments on it except maybe some occasional bug fixes, tweaks etc.
